		<h3>You CAN go home again!</h3>
    <p class='about'>
		For the first time in its history, the Madrid Dam Music Series is engaging in an effort to bring touring and performing professionals with roots in the North Country <strong>BACK HOME</strong> to the MDMS venue to share their music and the story of their professional journeys. We have specifically selected artists with diverse histories and cultural experiences to feature.
