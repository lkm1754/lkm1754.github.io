    <p class='about'>
        The Madrid Dam Music Series is a unique celebration of Madrid NY. We seek out performers who are based within 20-30 miles of Madrid, and we often feature especially talented students from Madrid Waddington Central School and SUNY Potsdam’s Crane School of Music. At each of our summer evenings we honor a local community group such as the Fire Department or Zumba dancers, and/or a local business or individual that has sponsored the event. Our audience is comprised of children and adults of all ages. Our events have become known throughout the area for their fun and festive atmosphere. All our events are family friendly, with no smoking or alcohol, and no strobe lights. Our events are free to all, and light refreshments are sold. Donations are gratefully accepted, and they are our primary source of support.

        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p class='about'>
            We have cooperative relationships with other organizations in town, including local churches, and the Madrid Beautification Program. We have established a partnership with the Hepburn Library of Madrid to co-host children’s events at the Library several times each year. Our annual ‘Potsdam Community Band’ concert takes place in the equine building at the St. Lawrence Power and Equipment Museum, which has the best ever acoustics. We in turn bring volunteers to assist with the Museum’s events.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class='about'>
            The MDMS was established in 2016 as a summer music series, with 10 weekly performances by local artists from the end of June through August. Our first season was a great success. We have added to our schedule a Fall Ball, monthly themed Sunday afternoon events in January through March, and a Spring Fling. All events take place at the Town Park. During the summer when weather permits performances are outside. From autumn to spring, events take place indoors in our Community Building at the park. The Town community building and the park that surrounds it is a beautiful location for our music series. The park sits next to the Grasse River and the centuries-old dam for which the series is named.
