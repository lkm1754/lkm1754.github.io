        <h2>Bandstand Project</h2>
        <div class='event bandstand'>
            <p>As you may know, the Planning Committee and the Friends of the Madrid Dam Music Series have been raising money for approximately two years with the aim of constructing a new bandstand as a gift for the people of Madrid. We are SO CLOSE to meeting our goal! Our audiences have donated generously to the bandstand project, as well as local businesses, especially Community Bank and Seacomm Federal Credit Union.</p>
            
            <p><strong>We are now excited to share that the Madrid Dam Music Series, in partnership with the town of Madrid, recently received a $5,000 matching grant from the Northern New York Community Foundation to build charitble support for the community bandstand project!</strong></p>
            
            <p>The current bandstand was built in the mid-1980's, and served the community well for many years. However, it is old and is not large enough for our current needs, has inadequate ventilation and is not positioned ideally for sound or for the early evening sun that shines into the eyes of performers. We are proposing to build a new bandstand that will have more space, better lighting and shade, improved acoustics, possibly some storage space, and a ramp for improved accessibility.</p>
            
            <p>For 90 years, the Northern New York Community Foundation has supported a variety of arts and culture programs and initiatives that have enhanced the quality of life for residents in St. Lawrence, Jefferson and Lewis counties. Through the generosity of people like you, the Community Foundation is able to make a strategic investment in community projects like ours and make a positive impact in the North Country. Individuals, families, businesses and organizations have given through the Community Foundation to support their passions now and in perpetuity.</p>
